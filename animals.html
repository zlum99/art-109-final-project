          <h2>African Elephant</h2>
          <p> Elephants are the heaviest land animal and the second tallest land animal on earth. An elephant's skin is grayish-brown and may be up to one inch thick in some places on the body. The trunk has two prehensile tips. Elephants walk on
            their tiptoes, called digitigrade, with thick fibrous pads on their toes to cushion the bones.</p>

          <h2>California Condor</h2>
          <p> They are notoriously massive birds, and have the longest wingspan of any bird of continental North America. They are predominantly black, with mostly bald heads. Their baggy, wrinkled skin is grey in the juvenile form, and varies from
            cream to reddish orange in adults. Long, white triangular stripes on the undersides of their wings distinguish them from other raptors in flight, e.g. Bald Eagles and Turley Vultures. The stripes appear mottled grey on juveniles.</p>
